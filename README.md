# MycroPython-Projects
My micro-python projects, created for the Raspberry Pico W

So far my projects are:
-class_rider
  A knight rider led configuration for a wsb2812b led strip, that can be easily modified

-clock_v2
  A table clock like configuration for a wsb2812b led circle, that gets it's time from the internet

-sound_sensitive
  Used on a wsb2812b led strip to make it so the light intensity changes depending on the input of an external microphone
